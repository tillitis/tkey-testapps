# rng_stream

## Introduction

This app will continuously generate random numbers and send to the
host as a stream of bytes. The generator is using a Hash_DRBG built
around the BLAKE2s hash function. The Hash_DRBG is periodically seeded
by the TKey TRNG entropy source.

The purpose of the app is to provide a hardware based source of high
quality random numbers to the host. This can be useful as the primary
source of randomness in an embedded system. This can also be used as a
way to improve the availability of randomness in a system, by feeding
the existing random source (/dev/random) with data from the generator.

## Usage

Load the app into the TKey device using 'tkey-runapp'. When the
application has been loaded it will start sending random bytes to the
host.

To collect random data simply do:

	'cat /dev/ttyACM0 > rng_data.bin'


## Implementation details

The Hash_DRBG is built around the BLAKE2s hash function.

The internal 512 bit RNG state contain the last 256 bit digest and 256
bit of entropy extracted from the TKey TRNG. A new complete hash
operation is calculated for each 128 bit block of random number data
generated. 128 bits of the resultinf digest is delivered to the host
and the whole digest is used to update the internal state.
Additionally the reseed counter is mixed into the 256 bits of entropy.
This means that the internal state is updated with at least 128 bits
between each each block delivered to the host.

Currently the generator will reseed after 1000 blocks of data, that is
after 16000 bytes.

The RNG stream application use a version of the BLAKE2s reference as
specified in [RFC 7693](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7693.html)
by Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen.
